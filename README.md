> A responsive, state-managing web application demonstrating fundamental DOM manipulation and event handling.

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a lightweight, interactive Counter Program built to demonstrate the core principles of **Frontend Development**. It showcases the interaction between the structural layer (HTML), the presentation layer (CSS), and the behavioral layer (JavaScript).

The application allows users to manipulate a numerical state in real-time with immediate visual feedback, featuring a clean, minimalist user interface.

## 🌟 Key Features
* **State Management:** Real-time tracking of numerical values using JavaScript variables.
* **Interactive Controls:** Three distinct functions to **Increase**, **Decrease**, or **Reset** the counter.
* **Dynamic DOM Updates:** Uses `document.getElementById()` and `textContent` to update the UI without reloading the page.
* **Responsive UI:** Styled with CSS3 featuring hover effects (`:hover`), smooth color transitions, and a centered layout for optimal user experience.


## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
The project follows the **Separation of Concerns** principle:
* **HTML5:** Semantically structured layout using container `divs` and `button` elements.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling using Helvetica typography, Flexbox alignment, and interactive state transitions (0.25s duration).
* **JavaScript (ES6):**
    * Event Listeners attached via `onclick` properties.
    * Logic implementation for arithmetic operations (`++`, `--`).
    * State reset functionality.

## 💻 How to Run Locally
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yes-oggy/Counter]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Launch:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
This project was developed to master:
* Connecting JavaScript to HTML elements.
* Handling user events (`click`).
* Manipulating CSS properties and text content dynamically.
* Writing clean, modular code.
